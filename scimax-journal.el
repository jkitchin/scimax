;;; scimax-journal.el --- Journal commands for orgmode

;;; Commentary:
;; This is a set of functions to make journaling in org-mode easier. A journal
;; entry is defined as an org-file in `scimax-journal-root-dir' that follows the
;; name convention year/month/day/year-month-day.org. These entries are saved in
;; an avl-tree to make it easy to navigate them. This data structure should keep
;; the entries sorted by date. The format of these filenames is not flexible at
;; this point.

;; There are many interactive functions, but I consider the main entry point to
;; be a hydra menu bound to `scimax-journal/body'. I suggest you bind this to a
;; convenient key of your choice, perhaps H-j. Then, you have the following actions:
;;
;; H-j j to open a new entry or the current entry
;; H-j e to open an entry from a previous date
;; H-j h to open a heading in the journal
;; H-j f to open a file in the journal (uses projectile)
;;
;; H-j n/p to navigate to the next/previous entries by date.
;;
;; There are a variety of search options. These commands should also take a
;; numeric prefix command to increase the number of units to search, e.g. H-j
;; C-u 2 sw would run swiper on the last two weeks of entries. Swiper is not
;; particularly fast for large time ranges, and requires the buffers to be
;; opened.

;; Swiper options:
;; H-j sr prompts you to pick two dates, and then uses swiper on that range
;; H-j sw uses swiper to search entries in the last week
;; H-j sm uses swiper to search entries in the last month
;; H-j sy uses swiper to search entries in the last year
;;
;; There are also grep versions of those commands, and agenda versions. With the
;; agenda commands you can use all the agenda search capabilities, e.g. tags,
;; keywords, properties, etc. The grep commands tend to be faster than swiper
;; and do not require the buffers to be open.
;;
;; H-j gr and H-j ar on a range
;; H-j gw and H-j aw for the last week
;; H-j gm and H-j gm for the last month
;; H-j gy and H-j ay for the last year
;; H-j ga and H-j aa for all the entries.
;;
;; The journal is registered as a projectile project, so you can also use any
;; functionality from `projectile' to search/find files, etc.
;; `projectile-ag' is another tool for searching.
;;
;; You can make a project specific journal with
;; `scimax-journal-make-directory-local'. This uses directory-local variables.

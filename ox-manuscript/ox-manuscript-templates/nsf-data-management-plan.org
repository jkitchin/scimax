* Types of data
# Samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project.
# 1.	What data will be generated in the research? (Give a short description, including amount – if known and the content of the data).
# 2.	What data types will you be creating or capturing? (E.g. experimental measures, observational or qualitative, model simulation, processed etc.)
# 3.	How will you capture or create the data?
# 4.	If you will be using existing data, state that fact and include where you got it. What is the relationship between the data you are collecting and the existing data?

* Data and Metadata Standards
# Standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (where existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, this should be documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies).
# 1.	Which file formats will you use for your data, and why?
# 2.	What contextual details (metadata) are needed to make the data you capture or collect meaningful?
# 3.	How will you create or capture these details?
# 4.	What form will the metadata take? Which metadata standards will you use?
# 5.	Why have you chosen particular standards and approaches for metadata and contextual documentation?  (e.g. recourse to staff expertise, Open Source, accepted domain-local standards, widespread usage)

* Policies for access and sharing and provisions for appropriate protection/privacy
# 1.	How will you make the data available? (Resources needed: equipment, systems, expertise, etc.)
# 2.	When will you make the data available?
# (Give details of any embargo periods for political/commercial/patent reasons.)
# What is the process for gaining access to the data?
# 3.	Will access be chargeable?
# 4.	Does the original data collector/ creator/ principal investigator retain the right to use the data before opening it up to wider use?

** Provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements;
# 1.	Are there ethical and privacy issues?
# 2.	If so, how will these be resolved? (E.g. anonymisation of data, institutional ethical committees, formal consent agreements.)
# 3.	Is the data 'personal data' in terms of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the DPA)? (Need equivalent HIPAA  requirement)
# 4.	What have you done to comply with your obligations in your IRB Protocol? Not necessary.
# 5.	Is the dataset covered by copyright? If so, who owns the copyright and other intellectual property?
# 6.	How will the dataset be licensed if rights exist? (E.g. any restrictions or delays on data sharing needed to protect intellectual property, copyright or patentable data.)


* Policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution
# 1.	Will any permission restrictions need to be placed on the data?
# 2.	Which bodies/groups are likely to be interested in the data?
# What and who are the intended or foreseeable uses / users of the data?
# Are there any reasons not to share or re-use data? (Suggestions: ethical, non-disclosure, etc.)

* Plans for archiving and Preservation of access
# Plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and Preservation of access to them.
# 1.	What is the long-term strategy for maintaining, curating and archiving the data?
# 2.	Which archive/repository/central database/ data centre have you identified as a place to deposit data?
# 3.	What transformations will be necessary to prepare data for preservation / data sharing? (E.g. data cleaning/anonymisation where appropriate.)
# 4.	What metadata/ documentation will be submitted alongside the data or created on deposit/ transformation in order to make the data reusable?
# 5.	What related information will be deposited (e.g. references, reports, research papers, fonts, the original bid proposal, etc.)
# 6.	How long will/should data be kept beyond the life of the project?
# 7.	What procedures does your intended long-term data storage facility have in place for preservation and backup?

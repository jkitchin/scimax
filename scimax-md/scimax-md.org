#+TITLE: A better Markdown exporter

Why? Don't we already have org-mode? Yes, but some places like Markdown, it is no fun to write when you have really technical documents, and it would be harder to get markdown-mode to be as good as org-mode than to do this.

Github's rendering of org-mode is only ok. This might be a nicer way to get better Github pages.

* Headings

It goes without saying I hope, that we use headings to organize things.
** subheading
*** subsubheading

Anything deeper than this gets turned into paragraphs by default.

* Markups

*bold* /italics/ _underline_ +strike+ =verbatim= ~code~

subscripts: H_{2}O

superscripts: H^{+}

Regular urls are fine: http://google.com.

* Lists

** Numbered lists

1. one
2. two
3. three


Note these letters will render as numbers.

a. apple
b. bear
c. cat


** plain lists

- one
- two
- three
  - with nesting
    - deeper
  - back in
- all the way

** checklists

- [ ] one
- [ ] two
- [ ] three

** definition lists

- org-mode :: what makes this possible
- emacs :: the other thing you need


* Equations

Suppose you have this equation to solve:

$$8 = x - 4$$  label:eq-sle

You can put a label near this and refer to it later.

* Code blocks

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 4, 8])
plt.savefig('geometric.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[1]:


# image/png
[[file:obipy-resources/6236b0f6cfbcdf4e56fd901258712017-49139zaF.png]]
:END:

* Figures

You might like a caption with a label you can refer to later. The figures aren't numbered; instead the labels are used. It seems possible to get numbering, but it would take some work.

#+caption: A figure with a  caption. label:fig-data
[[./geometric.png]]

** another figure


#+caption: Another figure to check numbering. label:fig-data-2
[[./geometric.png]]


* Tables

You can have tables, with captions and labels.

#+caption: A data table. label:tab-data
| x |  y |
|---+----|
| 1 |  1 |
| 2 |  4 |
| 3 |  9 |
| 4 | 16 |

Here is another table:

#+caption: A count of categories. label:tab-cat
| category | count |
|----------+-------|
| apples   |     2 |
| oranges  |     4 |

Tables are numbered in the export, but they export as html, and it is the org-html exporter taking care of this.

* Citations  label:sec-citations

You can have proper scientific citations like this cite:kitchin-2015-examp, including multiple references cite:kitchin-2015-data-surfac-scien,kitchin-2015-examp,kitchin-2016-autom-data. Check out the tooltips on them in the html that Github renders.

org-ref helps you insert citations from a bibtex database.

It is conceivable to have numbered citations, and fancier formatting, but I have no plans to implement that.

* Radio targets

In org-mode you can define a <<target>> that you can make a link to later.

* Cross-references

Remember Table ref:tab-data or the category Table (ref:tab-cat)?   Or that figure we put a caption on (Fig.  ref:fig-data).

How about section ref:sec-citations on citations?

Remember the [[target]] we referred to earlier?

What matters the most in cross-references is that org-ref helps you complete them.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
print(f'x = {8 + 4}')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[2]:
# output
: x = 12
:END:

The results above show the answer to Eq. ref:eq-sle.

* Exporting a single file

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'scimax-md)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: scimax-md

To a buffer:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(pop-to-buffer (org-export-to-buffer 'scimax-md "*scimax-md-export*"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<buffer *scimax-md-export*>

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'scimax-md)
(org-export-to-file 'scimax-md "scimax-md.md")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: scimax-md.md


bibliography:~/Dropbox/bibliography/references.bib

* Handling projects

Your project might have many org files that should all be published. No problem. First, setup your project, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(("scimax-md"
         :base-directory "/Users/jkitchin/vc/jkitchin-github/scimax/scimax-md/"
         :publishing-directory "/Users/jkitchin/vc/jkitchin-github/scimax/scimax-md/"
         :publishing-function scimax-md-publish-to-md)))

(require 'scimax-md)
(org-publish-current-project)
#+END_SRC

Now, we can test a link to another file:

1. A bare file link:  [[./ideas.md]].
2. A file link with description  [[./ideas.md][ideas]].

* Downsides to this approach

I never read or edit the markdown that is produced. There is probably a lot of stuff in it you would never write yourself. If that is a problem, there is a lot to do to get rid of it. Especially the way I use html to get features might not be considered very standard.

Here are some org-generated lines:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<a id="org0d027ad"></a>

You can have proper scientific citations like this <sup id="9e3ad98c9008c49c9d14834ca3913eb6"><a href="#kitchin-2015-examp" title="Kitchin, Examples of Effective Data Sharing in Scientific Publishing, {ACS Catalysis}, v(6), 3894-3899 (2015).">kitchin-2015-examp</a></sup>,
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is a one way conversion. If someone edits the markdown, and you re-export, you will clobber their changes.

Not every corner of org-mode has been tested yet. Might as well try one more thing:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish. – Neal Stephenson, In the Beginning was the Command Line (1998)
#+END_QUOTE

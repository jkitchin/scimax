Scimax is designed to help scientists and engineers do their work more effectively. A crucial task for us is documenting our work. A scimax notebook is a concept built on the idea that your work is probably connected to a project, and the work on that project is probably in some root directory on your computer. This library provides functions to facilitate that idea.

We build on the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] library which provides a persistent list of your projects, makes it easy to switch between them, etc. Here are the most common ones I use.

| keystrokes | action                     |
|------------+----------------------------|
| C-c pp     | Switch to a known project  |
| C-c pf     | Find file in project       |
| C-c pF     | Find file in /any/ project |
| C-c pb     | Switch to project buffer   |
| C-c pg     | Run grep in the project    |

There are /a lot/ of other commands you might want to review at https://www.projectile.mx/en/latest/usage/.

This module provides functions and capabilities for working in a scimax notebook.

Our concept of a notebook is that it is a directory that is a project as defined by projectile, which means it either has a file called .projectile in it or it is a git repo. We define a root directory for projects in =nb-notebook-directory=. Every notebook has a master file, README.org by default that is opened when you switch to the project.

- nb-new :: Interactively create a new notebook
- nb-open :: Interactively open an existing notebook to the master file
- nb-agenda :: Show the agenda for org-files in the notebook
- nb-archive :: Create an archive (customizable to be zip or tar) file of the project

;;; Commentary:
;; This is an experiment in using scimax and org-mode for scientific notebook
;; purposes. The idea is you have a "project" that is a set of org and other
;; files under version control (git). There is a "master" file that is the
;; starting point, e.g. the README.org file. You can use `projectile' to switch
;; between projects easily, or search/find files within a project.
;;
;; `nb-new' is command to create a new project, it is just a thin wrapper that
;; creates the directories, registers them with projectile, and opens the master
;; file.
;;
;; `nb-open' is a command to open an existing project. It is a thin wrapper
;; around the projectile-switch-project command that opens the master file.
;;
;; `nb-agenda' to see the TODO items within a project, or do other org-agenda
;; things within the scope of the project, e.g. search by tag/property.
;;
;; `nb-archive' creates a zip-archive of the project.
;;
;; Note there is a projectile hydra defined: `hydra-projectile/body' that may be
;; useful for scimax-notebooks.

** Notebook functions

*** Make a new notebook

We store all projects by default in nb-notebook-directory. You can use nested directories in this to make hierarchies of projects, e.g. if you have several research projects you might use research/project-one and research/project-two as the directory names. It is also ok to have even deeper nesting eg. letters/undergraduates/student-1 or administrative/nonsense/committees/committee-on-committees.

** Notebook agenda

I usually want to do project management in a notebook, e.g. keep track of TODOs, what to do next etc. I don't always put project org-files in my regular agenda files for performance reasons. Here we generate an agenda for that using just the org-files in the current directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp  :tangle yes :results silent

** Notebook archive files

The idea here is it is sometimes useful to create an archive file (e.g. a zip file) of your project, e.g. to upload to zenodo/figshare, or to share with a collaborator.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp  :tangle yes :results silent
;;;###autoload

  "Create an archive of the current notebook.
This uses git archive to create an archive of the current state
of the notebook. The zip file will be timestamped in the root
project directory. If your repo contains untracked files or
uncommitted changes, you will be prompted to continue."
  (let ((output (shell-command-to-string "git status --porcelain")))
    (unless (string= "" output)
      (when
	  (y-or-n-p

** List the tags in a notebook

The notebook is just a collection of org-files, so it should be possible to use the agenda commands to search for things in it using tags and properties. That means it would be helpful to get a list of tags in the notebook, e.g. to help construct the queries, or to make sure you use them consistently. Here we loop through all the org-files and collect the tags in a list. This is lightly tested, and in a large project might be slow.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp  :tangle yes :results silent
(defun nb-list-tags ()
  "Get a list of tags in the notebook."
  (interactive)
  (let ((tags '())

** Notebook menu

Sometimes I find it helpful to use a menu instead of keyboard commands. This creates that menu, so it is easy to create a new notebook or open an existing one, and also to see a list of known projects. When that list gets very long it can get somewhat slow to list them all. By default the list of projects is only made once when this library is loaded. You can set =nb-scimax-update-menu-p= to be non-nil so it is updated all the time, or manually run =nb-update-scimax-projects-menu= to update it if you have new projects you want to see there.

* Notebook/project links

I often want to make links between projects. For example, I may have notes in a proposal I want to reference, or I may want a link to work one of my students has done. Regular links don't work well for this. You cannot use absolute paths, because your project directory may be in another path than a collaborators. Absolute paths also break if you move the directory. Even relative paths don't work reliably because you may store the two projects in different relative locations. id links have potential to work, but I find them slow especially when you have never opened the org-file with that id in it; then org-mode may not be able to find it.

We need a different kind of link that allows you to specify a project, and a file in that project. Then, when you follow the link, it will look up the project in your list of known projects to get the root directory for it, and then construct a path to the file from that.

Here we define a new org-link for making links to files in notebooks. These links will look like nb:project-name::relative-file-path::link-target

- project-name :: Name of project, usually at the end of the absolute path to the project directory.
- relative-file-path :: Path to a file, usually relative to the project root
- link-target :: a number, or char position, or regexp to find in the file. For org-files, this can be any kind of org-link modifier.

** Tooltips for the link

The links have a tooltip that tells you the path that will be opened, or helpful information about issues with the link (not found, or multiple repos).

** Activating the link

I am a big fan of image overlays on links that are images. We make that happen for notebook links here.

** A keymap

I often want to open a link in the Finder/Explorer or bash. We make a keymap to make that easy here.

We have to get the link path and then open it.

It seems like we might want a hydra for various actions on a link. This would be useful if you don't remember the keymap.

  (interactive "e")
  (with-selected-window (nth 0 (cadr event))
    (goto-char (nth 1 (cadr event)))
    (nb-hydra/body)))

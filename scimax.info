Scimax - The manual
*******************

Scimax is an Emacs starterkit designed for people interested in
reproducible research and publishing. Scimax is just Emacs that has
been configured extensively to make it act like we need it to for
research documentation and publication. The notes below document some
features we have built into scimax.

   Note: The org-mode version of this manual is the preferred version
for reading; it is the most functional version, and the most up to
date. The *Note Top: (scimax)Top. version is also useful though, and
you might prefer that one.

1.1 Markup shortcuts
====================

scimax defines some shortcuts for org-mode markup. You can select text
and type the shortcut to wrap the region in the markup, or if on a
word, type the shortcut to wrap the word, or type the short cut to
create the markup with the cursor inside it to keep typing.

   Note these modifier keys:

S   shift
M   alt/meta
C   Ctrl
s   super
H   hyper

   Notation like s-b means press super and b together.

1.2 Block expansions in org-mode
================================

The following examples show the shortcuts defined in scimax for
expansion. Put your cursor after the shortcut and press tab to expand
them.

File: scimax.info,  Node: Better image scaling,  Next: new speed commands,  Prev: LaTeX,  Up: Org-mode

1.4 Better image scaling
========================

Image rescaling in org-mode/Emacs used to require an Emacs with
imagemagick support compiled in. This is a problem on Windows. Scimax
support image rescaling with an external imagemagick program called
mogrify. You can rescale the appearance of an image in org-mode by
adding an attribute like this above the figure.

   where resize-option is one of:
N%     to scale the image by a percentage.
N      to set the width, keeping the aspect ratio constant.
xN     to set the height, keeping the aspect ratio constant.
NxM!   to set the width and height, ignoring the aspect ratio.

   Here are some examples.

 [image src="./org-show/taskbar.png" ]

Figure: An unscaled image.

 [image src="./org-show/taskbar.png" ]

 [image src="./org-show/taskbar.png" ]

1.5 new speed commands
======================

scimax defines these new speed commands that are active when the cursor
is on the first character of a headline.

m   Mark the subtree
S   widen
k   kill the subtree
q   jump to a headline with avy
T   org-teleport (move headline)

   The best way to see other speed commands is to put your cursor at
the beginning of a headline and press ?. You can also run
`org-speed-command-help' to see a full list of speed commands.

1.6 Formatted copy and paste
============================

`ox-clip-formatted-copy' provides a way to copy org-mode with
formatting so it can be pasted into other programs like MS Word and web
browsers. It does this by copying the selected text to the HTML
clipboard.

* Track changes::
* Highlighting and annotation::
* org-ref::
* Publishing (ox-manuscript)::


File: scimax.info,  Node: Spell-checking,  Next: Autoformat,  Up: Writing tools

2.1 Spell-checking
==================

scimax is configured with flyspell and flycheck on. When you mispell a
word it will be underlined in red, and you will see a message in the
minibuffer that tells you how to fix it (C-;). Type that, and you will
be able to fix the word spelling without losing your place! Not only
that, but the correction will be saved as an abbreviation so it will
auto correct every time you make the mistake again! Note this only
works for single word corrections (i.e. the correction cannot be a two
word correction).

   If the word is correct, you can type M-o s to save the word in your
dictionary so you will not see it as misspelled again.


File: scimax.info,  Node: Autoformat,  Next: Track changes,  Prev: Spell-checking,  Up: Writing tools

2.2 Autoformat
==============

Scimax will auto-format several things for you.

  1. Ordinal numbers, e.g. 1st to 1^st.

  2. Fractions: 1/4 to ¼

  3. Some superscripts, e.g. cm2  to cm^2

  4. Transposed cAps, e.g. tHe to The

   These are controlled by the following variables you can customize
(they default to t):
   * `scimax-autoformat-ordinals'

   * `scimax-autoformat-fractions'

   * `scimax-autoformat-superscript'

   * `scimax-autoformat-transposed-caps'

   To get the autoformatting you have to enable
`scimax-autoformat-mode'. If you want it on all the time, add something
like this to your init files:

     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'scimax-autoformat-mode)

   scimax also defines some abbreviations that you can toggle on and
off. The abbreviations are defined in these variables:

  1. Auto-capitalization of weekdays and months, e.g. Monday and June.
       1. `scimax-month-abbreviations'

       2. `scimax-weekday-abbreviations'

  2. Contraction expansion: cant to can not and can't  to can not
       1. `scimax-contraction-abbreviations'

  3. Commonly transposed letters in words: teh to the
       1. `scimax-transposition-abbreviations'

  4. Some common chemicals like co2 to CO_2
       1. `scimax-chemical-formula-abbreviations'

  5. Some convenience symbols like degC to °C and Ang to Å, and some
     names like norskov to Nørskov.
       1. `scimax-misc-abbreviations'

   You should be able to undo any expansion with C-/. Alternatively you
can prevent the expansion by typing C-q after the abbreviation before
the next character is typed.

   These are not on by default. You have to enable them with commands
like the one below in your init file. Use +1 to enable the abbrevs, and
-1 to disable the abbrevs that are defined in the variable.

     (scimax-toggle-abbrevs 'scimax-month-abbreviations +1)

   `scimax-toggle-abbrevs' is an interactive command you can use to
toggle the abbreviations on and off. If you run that command it will
toggle the state of the abbrevs. With a single prefix arg it will turn
them on, and with a double prefix arg turn them off.

   You can see the abbreviations defined with this command
`edit-abbrevs'.

2.3 Track changes
=================

Scimax provides some support for track changes and edit marks in
org-mode.

   `Add this text' `Delete this'  `A comment'

   The markup is clickable, and clicking on it deletes the markup.

   You can use these commands
   * `em-insert' - insert text at point

   * `em-delete' - mark the selected text for deletion

   * `em-comment' - insert a comment from minibuffer and comment
     history.

   * `em-comment-1' - insert a comment at point with buffer editing,
     and multiline comments.

   * `em-replace' - marks selected text for deletion, inserts new text

   * `em-editmarks' - list all editmarks in an ivy selection buffer.

   On an editmark you can:
   * `em-accept-edit-mark-at-point'

   * `em-reject-edit-mark-at-point'

   * `em-delete-edit-mark-at-point'

   -`em-typo' to mark a `tpyo'

   scimax provides some commands to:
   * `em-accept-all-changes'

   * `em-reject-all-changes'

   You can navigate the editmarks with:
   * `em-next-editmark'

   * `em-previous-editmark'

   Note, for the next commands, you need a working wdiff command.

   You can also create diffs between git commits using helm to select
them.
   * `em-wdiff-git'

   The commands all have key bindings. The prefix key for these is H-e.
     (loop for (char . func) in (cdr em-map) collect (list (char-to-string char) (format "`%s'" func)))

m   `em-comment'
w   `em-wdiff-git'
R   `em-reject-all-changes'
A   `em-accept-all-changes'
j   `em-reject-edit-mark-at-point'
a   `em-accept-edit-mark-at-point'
p   `em-previous-editmark'
n   `em-next-editmark'
o   `org-inlinetask-insert-task'
r   `em-replace'
l   `em-editmarks'
k   `em-delete-editmark-at-point'
d   `em-delete'
i   `em-insert'
c   `em-comment-1'
t   `em-typo'


File: scimax.info,  Node: Highlighting and annotation,  Next: org-ref,  Prev: Track changes,  Up: Writing tools

2.4 Highlighting and annotation
===============================

Scimax provides some support for highlighting, comment overlays, and
edit marks.

   The main way to access the functions is via a hydra menu:
`ov-highlighter/body' that is bound to H-h (hyper-h).

   The highlights are not part of org-mode, and they do not export to
any backend. The highlights should work in any kind of file.

2.5 org-ref
===========

org-ref is the answer to citations and bibliographies in scientific
writing. Run `org-ref-help'  and read it.


File: scimax.info,  Node: Publishing (ox-manuscript),  Prev: org-ref,  Up: Writing tools

2.6 *TODO* Publishing (ox-manuscript)
=====================================

The key-binding C-c C-e j should enter the ox-manuscript export menu.
This process differs from the regular export process in a number of
ways. It will detect if bibtex, makeindex, or  makeglossary, and if
minted is used, -shell-escape will automatically be used with pdflatex.
The function `ox-manuscript-latex-pdf-process' handles all of that.

   Additionally, you can generate different outputs of an org-file:

`ox-manuscript-build-submission-manuscript-and-open'
     creates a standalone tex file with embedded bibliography, and
     image extensions stripped, and the pdf file.

`ox-manuscript-make-submission-archive'
     creates a directory containing all the files you normally need for
     submission.

`ox-manuscript-toggle-interactive-build'
     if you are having trouble building a PDF, this will show you what
     happens at each step.


     `ox-manuscript-nobibliography'

`ox-manuscript-texcount'
     Estimate how many words are in your manuscript. For when you are
     limited to a fixed number of words.

3 Bibliography management
*************************

Bibliographies in scimax are stored in bibtex files. A bibtex file is a
plain text file containing bibtex entries. Each entry describes an
item. Here is a typical example.

     @article{kitchin-2015-examp,f
       author =         {Kitchin, John R.},
       title =         {Examples of Effective Data Sharing in Scientific Publishing},
       journal =         {ACS Catalysis},
       volume =         {5},
       number =         {6},
       pages =         {3894-3899},
       year =         2015,
       doi =                 {10.1021/acscatal.5b00538},
       url =                 { http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5b00538 },
       keywords =         {DESC0004031, early-career, orgmode, Data sharing },
       eprint =         { http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5b00538 },
     }

   This entry identifies the item as an article, labels it with a key
(kitchin-2015-examp), and describes the details of the item in a series
of key = {value} lines. You can learn more about bibtex here
`http://www.bibtex.org'.

   If you know the DOI I recommend you use `doi-add-bibtex-entry' as
much as possible to add bibtex entries to your bibliography files. This
will add properly formatted and cleaned entries and download the pdf if
it knows how. You may also find `crossref-add-bibtex-entry' useful if
you have a freeform citation and want to search for it.

   In a bibtex file, `org-ref-bibtex-hydra/body' will give you a menu
of options to do things on an entry including:

  1. Search pubmed, WebOfScience (wos), wos-citing, wos-related,
     crossref, and google scholar using the DOI or title of the entry.

  2. Clean the entry, replace non-ascii characters, sort the entry
     fields, or change the case of the title.

  3. Update the entry or fields using the doi.

  4. Open the notes, pdf, or url associated with the entry.

  5. Email the entry to someone

  6. Copy or cut the entry to paste somewhere

  7. Copy a formatted bibliography entry

  8. Add tags to an entry

  9. Add a new entry

   `org-ref-bibtex-file/body' provides menu access to bibtex file
functions:
  1. `bibtex-validate' - Checks if the file is syntactically valid, and
     for duplicate keys.

  2. `bibtex-sort-buffer'

  3. `bibtex-reformat'

  4. `bibtex-count-entries'

  5. `org-ref-build-full-bibliography'

3.1 Searching your bibliography files
=====================================

I like `helm-bibtex'. You type C-SPC to mark multiple entries. Type TAB
to see what actions you can perform on the entries.

3.2 Bibtex entries
==================

Here are the bibtex entry types and fields you should use. You can add
extra fields like keywords, doi, url, notes, etc... to each entry.
Usually they will be ignored by bibtex, but they are useful for you.
Note that biblatex (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex?lang=en) is
considered a more powerful bibliography formatting tool, but we use
bibtex because that is what most of the publishers we use support.

     (loop for (type doc required crossref optional) in bibtex-BibTeX-entry-alist
           do
           (princ (format "\n*** %s (%s)\n" type doc))
           (princ "\n**** Required fields\n\n")
           (loop for field in required
                 do
                 (princ (format "- %s" (car field)))
                 (message "%s" field)
                 (if (>= (length field) 2)
                     (princ (format " :: %s\n" (nth 1 field)))
                   (princ "\n")))

           (princ "\n**** Optional if Crossref present but otherwise required fields\n\n")
           (loop for field in crossref
                 do
                 (princ (format "- %s" (car field)))

           (loop for field in optional
                 do

3.3 Bibtex hotkeys
==================

Scimax provides hotkeys for when your cursor is on the @ at the
beginning of an entry. Here are the currently defined hotkeys.

     (require 'bibtex-hotkeys)
     (loop for (key . desc) in bibtex-hotkeys collect (list key desc))

y   Paste last entry
w   Move entry down
T   Title-case article
S   Sentence-case title
s   Move entry up
F   Jump to field with avy
?   Show hotkeys
p   Jump to previous entry
n   Jump to next entry
I   Inspect
l   Clean entry
k   Kill the entry
f   Copy formatted
e   Email entry
c   Copy entry

4 Email utilities
*****************

`email-buffer'
     email the whole buffer

`email-region'
     emails selected region

`email-heading'
     email the current heading, including properties, deadlines, etc...

`email-heading-body'
     email just the body of the current heading

`email-bibtex-entry'
     email the bibtex entry at point

* Menu:

* mail merge::


File: scimax.info,  Node: html mail,  Next: mail merge,  Up: Email utilities

4.1 html mail
=============

You can send html email from org-mode.

   From an org-file run `org-mime'. You will be prompted for the scope
to send, which is either the whole buffer, the heading you are in, or
the selected region. Then you will select how to make the email: html
will export the text to html and put it in an email, and htmlize will
use the htmlize library to generate the html.

   Alternatively, you may want to type org-mode directly in an email
buffer. Use `org-mime-compose-mail' to do that.


File: scimax.info,  Node: mail merge,  Prev: html mail,  Up: Email utilities

4.2 mail merge
==============

scimax provides some tools to do a mail merge in org-mode. The idea is
to run `mail-merge-make-headings' with a template and data-source to
generate a series of org-mode headings that are the messages. You can
inspect these, edit them if needed, and then run `mail-merge' to
actually send them. Each heading will be tagged as sent, and marked
DONE.

5 Contacts
**********

scimax provides a emacs-lisp library to interface with a contact
database written in org-mode.

   First, add some org-files to the variable `contacts-files'. Any
headline in these files that has an EMAIL property will be considered a
contact. Then, you can search your database with `ivy-contacts' or
`helm-contacts'. There are a variety of actions to choose from ranging
from inserting email addresses, copying properties, opening contact
urls, etc...

   See `contacts-help' for more information.

  1. Interactve rebasing

     Open the log, select the oldest commit you want to rebase on then
     press "r" and then "i". Use M-p and M-n to move commits around.
     Press "s" on any commits you want to squash into the commit above
     it. C-c C-c will start the commands.

     From the magit-status on unpushed commits, you can also press "r"
     to get the rebase popup.

  2. Reword a commit message

     "r w" allows you to reword the commit message.

   A typical use of notes is to supplement a commit message without
changing the         commit itself. Notes can be shown by git log along
with the original         commit message. To distinguish these notes
from the message stored in         the commit object, the notes are
indented like the message, after an         unindented line saying
"Notes (<refname>):" (or "Notes:" for         refs/notes/commits).

8 Project management - projectile
*********************************

`https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile' for project management. A
project is basically a directory under version control, e.g. git.

   Projectile makes it easy to jump to projects, find files in
projects, search projects, etc...

C-c p p   Switch to a project
C-c p k   Kill project buffers

   You can see all the key bindings with C-c p C-h.

   While in a project, you may want to try:

   `helm-projectile-grep' or `counsel-git-grep' to search all project
files for a phrase.

File: scimax.info,  Node: Python,  Next: Asynchronous Python,  Up: Programming

9.1 Python
==========

   * scimax is setup with `elpy-mode'.

   * `pydoc' provides nice, hyperlinked documentation for python.


File: scimax.info,  Node: Asynchronous Python,  Next: Jupyter/Ipython,  Prev: Python,  Up: Programming

9.2 Asynchronous Python
=======================

You can run python blocks asynchronously with M-x
`org-babel-async-execute:python' with the cursor in a code block. This
will allow you to keep typing, and show you a buffer with the progress
of your code block. When it is done, the results will be inserted into
the buffer where it belongs when the job is done. A temporary hash mark
will go in the results.

   You can make this the default behavior by adding this to your init
file:

     (add-to-list 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook 'org-babel-async-execute:python)


File: scimax.info,  Node: Jupyter/Ipython,  Next: Emacs-lisp,  Prev: Asynchronous Python,  Up: Programming

9.3 Jupyter/Ipython
===================

If you like sessions in Python, the ob-ipython library is better than
the default ob-python in org-mode.

   Pygments doesn't support ipython out of the box for some reason,
which is a problem if you want to export your src block to LaTeX.
scimax fixes this for you and automatically installs this if you don't
already have it.

   ob-ipython allows you to use Ipython magic commands in your src
blocks. Here is a protypical Ipython src block with a line magic.

     %time print("hello world")
     a = 6

     hello world
     CPU times: user 32 µs, sys: 5 µs, total: 37 µs
     Wall time: 39.8 µs

   And a block with cell magic.

     %%timeit
     7

   * `ob-ipython-inspect' seems to be broken

   * `org-babel-switch-to-session' will open the IPython REPL.

* Export org to ipynb::
* Using other kernels - hy::


File: scimax.info,  Node: Scimax enhancements to ob-ipython,  Next: Export org to ipynb,  Up: Jupyter/Ipython

9.3.1 Scimax enhancements to ob-ipython
---------------------------------------

We have made a few improvements to ob-ipython. Inline images are
supported now similar to how they are supported in the Jupyter
notebook. You specify the %matplotlib inline magic, and then plots will
appear "inline" along with any output from your cell block. The plots
are saved in a directory ipython-inline-images in filenames derived
from and md5 hash of the image. You can have more than one image, and
you also get the output from your block, similar to the way the Jupyter
notebook behaves.

   You need a header like this, i.e. you need to specify the results as
output, and for them to be in a drawer so that org-mode can display the
file links.

     #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer

     print('Hello world!')

     %matplotlib inline
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     import numpy as np

     x = np.linspace(0, 20 * np.pi, 200)
     y = np.exp(-0.1 * x) * np.sin(x)
     plt.plot(x, y)
     plt.xlabel('x')
     plt.ylabel('y')
     plt.title('Decaying sin wave')

     # new plot
     plt.figure()
     y2 = np.exp(-0.1 * x) * np.cos(x)
     plt.plot(x, y2)
     plt.xlabel('x')
     plt.ylabel('y')
     plt.title('Decaying cosine')

   Hello world!   [image src="ipython-inline-images/ob-ipython-16d0b561f004e2fd3ff8cba4dfd648b1.png" ]  [image src="ipython-inline-images/ob-ipython-4c47a49cc1cb84980ecbb91aef2e5b20.png" ]

   It also works with :results set to value.

     %matplotlib inline
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     import numpy as np

     x = np.linspace(0, 20 * np.pi, 200)
     y = np.exp(-0.1 * x) * np.sin(x)
     plt.plot(x, y)
     plt.xlabel('x')
     plt.ylabel('y')
     plt.title('Decaying sin wave')

     a = 5
     b = 6
     a + b

   11  [image src="ipython-inline-images/ob-ipython-16d0b561f004e2fd3ff8cba4dfd648b1.png" ]

   We also support HTML and Latex outputs like this. The results will
contain an HTML or LaTeX block. As with the Jupyter notebook

     from IPython.display import HTML, Latex

     HTML('H<sub>2</sub>O')

   and

     Latex('H$_2$O')

   As with the Jupyter notebook, only the last returned cell is
rendered.

  1. Asynchronous evaluation

     We finally have asynchronous execution of ipython blocks. This
     allows you to run a block, and keep working in Emacs. A temporary
     string is inserted into the results which is replaced when the
     code is done running. This command will make a clickable link to
     interrupt the kernel, or cancel the cell running. This will put
     names on every src block if they are not already named.

          import time
          time.sleep(5)
          #print(8)

          %matplotlib inline
          import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
          import numpy as np

          x = np.linspace(0, 20 * np.pi, 200)
          y1 = np.exp(-0.1 * x) * np.sin(x)
          y2 = np.exp(-0.1 * x) * np.cos(x)
          plt.plot(y1, y2)
          plt.xlabel('x')
          plt.ylabel('y')
          plt.title('Decaying spiral')

      [image src="ipython-inline-images/ob-ipython-f7122a4c0570fc3bf4ef580b97d5c1ae.png" ]

     You can run all the blocks asynchronously with
     `org-babel-execute-ipython-buffer-async'. You can clear the queue
     `org-babel-async-ipython-clear-queue'.

-------------------------

Finally, we can export org-mode files to Jupyter notebooks with the
ox-ipynb library. If you load the library, there is a new export option
in the export menu with the letter "n". Or you can use
`ox-ipynb-export-to-ipynb-file-and-open'.

   scimax provides the jupyter-hy src block to run hylang in src
blocks. The required :session and :kernel headers are automatically
provided.

10 RSS feeds
************

It is a major challenge to keep up with the scientific literature.
`elfeed' is the package we use in scimax for that. It aggregates RSS
feeds and provides a pretty easy way to consume them, capture them in
to org-mode, search them, and do things with them. scimax preconfigures
elfeed with some python, and emacs feeds, and you can easily add new
feeds:

     (add-to-list 'elfeed-feeds "http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/accacs")

   or if you want entries from a feed to be automatically tagged, e.g.
anything from Nature magazine could be tagged with nature:

     (add-to-list 'elfeed-feeds '("http://feeds.nature.com/nchem/rss/current" nature))

   Elfeed is configured to run every half hour after Emacs is started.

   On an entry you can type:
e   email entry to someone
c   capture the entry to org-mode
d   add bibtex entry

   In the list of entries you can type:
f,j   marks entry as read
o     open the entry
b     open browser to entry url
s     start a search query (see `https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed#filter-syntax')

11.4 ore
========

This command: `ore' tells you about the org-element your point is on.
It gives some hints on commands you can use on the element, and
provides a way for you to write your own notes.


File: scimax.info,  Node: org-show,  Next: org-db,  Prev: ore,  Up: Miscellaneous scimax utilities

11.5 org-show
=============

This is a simple library to make simple presentations in org-mode. See
`org-show-help' for an example use.


File: scimax.info,  Node: org-db,  Prev: org-show,  Up: Miscellaneous scimax utilities

11.6 org-db
===========

`org-db' is an org-mode database. When it is active every org-mode file
you visit will be indexed into a sqlite database. In each file, each
headline with its title, tags and properties are stored, and every link
in each file is stored.

   This becomes useful because you can then search all of your
org-files and jump to different locations.

`org-db-open-heading'
     Jump to a heading

`org-db-contacts'
     jump to a heading with an email property

`org-db-open-file'
     open a file in the db

`org-db-open-recent-file'
     open a list of recent files from the db

`org-db-locations'
     open a heading with an address property

   You can add a lot of files with `org-db-index'.

   When active, every time you save an org-file it will be added to a
queue to be indexed during idle time.

13 Scientific notebook
**********************

scimax provides a scientific notebook capability. Each "notebook" is
actually collection of org-files in a "project". A project is the set
of files in a directory that is under git version control. Each project
should have a master file (the default is README.org, but you can
customize `nb-master-file' to change this). The master file contains
what ever you want, but typically it links to other documents in the
project and provides an overview of the project.

   You are basically free to structure the notebook however you want.
You have all the freedom of org-mode at your fingers to document your
work.

   We leverage projectile (http://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for project management in the notebook. We use magit (https://magit.vc)
for version control.

   Use `nb-new' to create a new project. You will be prompted for a
name, which must be a valid directory name. The directory will be
created in `nb-notebook-directory'. Note that all git repos will be
considered projects, so it is not necessary to use `nb-new'. It just
automates a few things for you.

   Use `nb-open' to open a project. This will open the project to your
master file. Previously visited projects are remembered by projectile
and should be shown in an ivy completion minibuffer for selection.

   Probably you will keep your projects separate from your agenda
files, but you still would like to see what tasks the project has? Use
`nb-agenda' while in your project, and it will show you all the tasks
in the org-files associated with the project.

   Here are some other interesting commands you may want to use.

`counsel-git-grep'
     grep for a string in the project

`projectile-find-file'
     jump to a file in the project

`projectile-switch-to-buffer'
     switch to a project buffer

`projectile-kill-buffers'
     kill all the buffers associated with the project

   These commands help you navigate to a headline.

`ivy-org-jump-to-heading'
     in the current file

`ivy-org-jump-to-heading-in-directory'
     in the current directory

`ivy-org-jump-to-project-headline'
     in the project

`counsel-org-tag'
     add/remove tags on a headline

   You can manage the version control with *Note Magit::. There are
also keyboard shortcuts for version control. Type C-x v C-h to see them.

   * `vc-next-action' will do the next logical thing for vc, e.g. add
     or commit.

   * `vc-diff' will show you what has changed in the buffer since the
     last commit.

   * `vc-print-log' will show you the vc log.

   scimax defines these additional key bindings:

C-x v p   git push
C-x v P   git pull

* Menu:

* Archive the notebook with git::


File: scimax.info,  Node: Archive the notebook with git,  Up: Scientific notebook

13.1 Archive the notebook with git
==================================

Sometimes you may want a zip file of your notebook. You can use the
`nb-archive' command to create a zip file of the current state of your
notebook. This can be useful to back up versions of your project, send
copies to collaborators who don't use git, or to create archives for
data sharing and supporting information.

   Note that only files under version control are archived, and only
the current committed state is archived. So, uncommitted files and
changes will not be included.


File: scimax.info,  Node: ivy/counsel,  Next: scimax-hydras,  Prev: Scientific notebook,  Up: Top

14 ivy/counsel
**************

scimax currently uses ivy extensively for completion, and enables
`ivy-mode' and `counsel-mode'. The default matching behavior is
`ivy-regex-ignore-order'.

   When you get an ivy minibuffer, start typing to select what you
want, and when it is highlighted, press enter.

   There are a couple of nuances though.

  1. To eliminate matches use ! pattern, but you can only use one of
     these, and it comes last.

   I have extended the `ivy-minibuffer-map' to enable the following:

  1. M-spc will show the actions, and spc to resume the selection
     process.

  2. C-RET to perform the action and move to the next candidate, and
     C-u C-RET to perform the action and move to the previous candidate.

  3. M-RET will perform the default action on every candidate from the
     current selection to the end of the candidates. C-u M-RET does
     that from the current candidate to the beginning.

  4. s-RET quits the selection buffer with no action.

  5. ? shows you the keymap.

   In the ivy selection buffer
M-spc           Show the actions
spc             resume
RET             Default action and exit
C-RET           Default action and move to next line
C-u C-RET       Default action and move to previous line
M-RET           Default action on each candidate from current to end
C-u M-RET       Default action on each candidate from current to beginning
C-u C-u M-RET   Default action on all candidates
s-RET           quit with no action
?               show keymap help

   I use Hyper-c as a prefix map for a these commands.

     The body can be accessed via ‘scimax/body’.

   So, instead of C-x C-f to open a file (which still works by the way)
you can simply type: f12 ff. Or instead of C-x C-s to save the file,
type f12 RET. Each hydra will show you a hint in the minibuffer on
which keys do what.

16.1 Emacs
==========

Emacs is described as "self-documenting", and it provides a lot of
introspective ways to access documentation. A classic way to access
help is via "info" pages. These are hyperlinked documents containing a
lot of detail about Emacs and its libraries.

   Emacs-manual: *Note Top: (Emacs)Top.

n   goto next page
u   up a node
d   Main directory
?   list of keys and commands
q   quit

Table 16.1: Type these keys to do some basic navigation in an Info page.

16.1.1 Getting help on Emacs functions
--------------------------------------

To get help on functions use: `counsel-describe-function' and on
variables use `counsel-describe-variable'.

   If you do not know exactly what you are looking for try:
`helm-apropos'. This covers commands, functions, variables, faces,
classes, and some other things.

16.1.2 Getting help on system commands
--------------------------------------

If you have man pages installed (Linux/Mac for sure, maybe on windows)
you can access them easily via Emacs. I like to read man pages in Emacs
with `helm-man-woman' although `man' is also good.

   Note while on a man page you can use these keys:

   m       Prompt to retrieve a new manpage.  r       Retrieve
reference in SEE ALSO section.  M-n   Jump to next manpage in circular
list.  M-p   Jump to previous manpage in circular list.  n       Jump
to next manpage section.  p       Jump to previous manpage section.  g
    Go to a manpage section.  s       Jumps to the SEE ALSO manpage
section.  q       Deletes the manpage window, bury its buffer.  k
Deletes the manpage window, kill its buffer.  ?       Prints this help
text.

   scimax also defines a link for man pages.

16.1.3 What happens if I press a key?
-------------------------------------

The `describe-key' function will prompt you for a key sequence or you
can click on a menu item to see what it does.

   The `describe-mode' function will provide a full list of all the
keybindings in the current buffer.

   In org-mode the `ore' command will give you information about the
org-element under your cursor, including some commands that you can use
at the point. You can also customize this by adding your own notes
(click on User documentation in the help buffer).

16.1.4 How do I learn shortcuts?
--------------------------------

If you use the menus, they will often have the shortcut in the menu.

   The help functions usually show you if a shortcut is defined for a
command.

   If you really want to define your own keys, see `define-key' and
`global-set-key'.

   Make yourself some notes in org-mode using
`emacs-keybinding-command-tooltip-mode'.

17.1 Navigation - navy
======================

`navy' opens a hydra for navigation. The following keys are bound to
commands that do something in the following senses

j   left
l   right
i   up
k   down

   The default mode is character mode, and you can change the mode with
single characters, include a word mode (w), sentence (s), paragraph
(p), page (g), line (n) and sexp (x) mode. These modes allow you
navigate forward and backward by those elements. They also define
binding

   I have tried to make the following keys consistent:

;   avy-goto-char-2
'   avy-goto-line
<   goto point-min
>   goto point-max

   There are some useful bindings in `navy' also.
r   counsel-git-grep
o   helm-org-agenda-files-headings
a   swiper-all


File: scimax.info,  Node: Hotspots,  Prev: Navigation - navy,  Up: Archive

17.2 Hotspots
=============

`hotspots' is a helm command that provides easy access to a variety of
locations including user-defined commands, locations, org-agenda files,
recent files, and bookmarks.

   You customize `scimax-user-hotspot-commands' and
`scimax-user-hotspot-locations'.

   I bind this to a key like "f9" and set it up to easily open my mail,
calendar and other things. For example, here is part of my setup.

     (setq scimax-user-hotspot-commands
           '(("Mail" . (lambda ()
                         (browse-url "https://www.google.com/gmail")))
             ("Calendar" . (lambda ()
                             (browse-url "https://www.google.com/calendar/render")))
             ("Contacts" . ivy-contacts)
             ("RSS" . elfeed)
             ("Twitter" . twit)
             ("Agenda" . (lambda () (org-agenda "" "w")))
             ("CV" . (lambda ()
                       (org-open-file
                        "/Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/CMU/CV and bios/kitchin_cv.docx" '(16))))))

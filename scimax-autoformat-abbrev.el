;;; Commentary:
;;
;; These variables control the autoformatting capability in org-mode. They
;; default to t. To turn on autoformatting you have to turn on
;; `scimax-autoformat-mode'.

;; - `scimax-autoformat-superscripts'
;; - `scimax-autoformat-transposed-caps'
;; - `scimax-autoformat-ordinals'
;; - `scimax-autoformat-fractions'
;; - `scimax-autoformat-sentence-capitalization'

;; The variable `scimax-org-autoformat-functions' has a list of functions that
;; are called in the `scimax-org-autoformat'.

;; This module also defines a set of abbreviations that may be helpful. The definitions are defined in these variables which you can customize:
;; - `scimax-month-abbreviations'
;; - `scimax-weekday-abbreviations'
;; - `scimax-contraction-abbreviations'
;; - `scimax-transpositions-abbreviations'
;; - `scimax-chemical-formula-abbreviations'
;; - `scimax-misc-abbreviations'

;; They are disabled by default. To enable them, use commands like:
;; (scimax-toggle-abbrevs 'scimax-month-abbreviations 1) These abbreviations do
;; not expand in src-blocks or name/tblname/latex_headers. This is controlled by
;; the variable `scimax-abbrev-function' which is a function that takes no args
;; and returns non-nil if an abbreviation should be expanded at the current
;; point.

;; This module also sets up flyspell to save abbrevs so they autocorrect in the
;; future. The variable `scimax-save-spellcheck-abbrevs' defaults to t, and
;; saves any workd you correct with flyspell as an abbrev. It also binds C-x C-i
;; to a function that calls ispell on a word, and then creates an abbrev for the
;; selection you make.
;;
;; Finally, this library advises `undo-tree-undo' so that you can easily undo an
;; abbrev expansion.

;;; Code:

(setq save-abbrevs 'silently)
(setq-default abbrev-mode t)

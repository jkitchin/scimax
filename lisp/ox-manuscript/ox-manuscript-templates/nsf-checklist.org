** Budget notes

A business manager typically prepares this. You provide information like this:

Typical items:
- student tuition, stipend, fees
- 1 month summer salary
- travel
- supplies
- Other (equipment, etc)

They take care of the preparation

Usually a Justification is required. There is a specific form the University uses.

- Provide the Statement of work (brief summary) for OSP
- Sign the SPEX form

** Project Summary Notes

(Plain text, 3 sections, about a page)
You must have an Overview, Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts section. Send this in plain text and it will be pasted it into boxes on Research.gov.

** References Cited

These must be in a separate file. Each reference must include all authors.

** Project Description Notes

Prior NSF support sections must explicitly identify intellectual merit and broader impacts.

* Build

Refresh all the files with a fresh build.

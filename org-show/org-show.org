#+TITLE: org-show - simple presentations in org-mode
#+AUTHOR: John Kitchin

There are several options for "presenting" from org-mode. Here are the options I found.

The one I like the best is discussed here: http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-present-using-org-mode-in-emacs/. I like it best because you can edit the slides as you go, execute arbitrary emacs code, and it is still pretty simple. I used Sacha's code as the basis for org-show. There is a lot of similarity.

elisp:org-show-mode

elisp:org-show-start-slideshow

* org-show
You can have:

1. code run
2. split to show slide and full image
3. plain text

** Title slide							      :slide:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(org-show-animate '("Welcome to the org-show" "John Kitchin"))
#+END_SRC

** Presentations in org-mode					      :slide:
This should be easy

1. Create your org-file. Tag headlines with :slide:
2. Enter org-show-mode, press f5. Use PageUp and PageDn to navigate slides
3. Go back and forth from the presentation to other files in Emacs or other software.
4. Edit yours slides as you go, e.g. to demonstrate something
5. Totally interactive, run code, etc...

org-show is based on this blog post: http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-present-using-org-mode-in-emacs/

Thanks Sacha!

** Equations							      :slide:
It should be easy to show equations like this  $\int_0^x \frac{1}{2} \sin x dx = 6$.

It is. Maybe you prefer equation environments?

\begin{equation}
e^x = 55
\end{equation}

Want to see the equation source? elisp:org-toggle-latex-overlays

Back to equations: C-c C-x C-l
** Figures							      :slide:

Figures show inline.

Here is a little screen capture:
[[./taskbar.png]]

** Need a more complicated layout?				      :slide:
Write some code to generate it, and put it in an emacs-lisp-slide block. org-show will run it and show you the result

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(delete-other-windows)
(split-window-right)
(other-window 1)
(find-file "taskbar.png")
(split-window-below)
(other-window 1)
(find-file "doi-utils.org")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<buffer doi-utils.org>

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(delete-other-windows)
(split-window-right)
(other-window 1)
(find-file "taskbar.png")
(split-window-below)
(other-window 1)
(find-file "doi-utils.org")
,#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

** A complicated layout						      :slide:
- We use a special emacs-lisp-slide block to configure the slide arrangement

- So we can have bullets here

- Figures in another window

- and something else in another window

Here is the custom code block.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(delete-other-windows)
(split-window-right)
(other-window 1)
(find-file "taskbar.png")
(split-window-below)
(other-window 1)
(find-file "org-show.el")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:




** Code blocks should be runnable and editable			      :slide:

#+BEGIN_SRC python results: output
print 6 + 62
#+END_SRC


They are.
** We can use many languages					      :slide:
(of course, you must have them installed on your computer)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(+ 6 6)
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC R
sum(c(6, 6))
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC perl :results output
print 6 + 6
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
print 6 + 6
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("%d", 6 + 6);
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

And so on, and so forth...



** Interactivity is important
We get it.
*** Snake							      :slide:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(snake)
#+END_SRC

*** tetris							      :slide:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(when (and (boundp 'snake-buffer-name) (get-buffer snake-buffer-name))
  (kill-buffer snake-buffer-name))
(delete-other-windows)
(tetris)
#+END_SRC


*** doctor							      :slide:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(doctor)
#+END_SRC


*** Become a graffiti artist					      :slide:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(progn
  (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "*artist*"))
  (erase-buffer)
  (artist-mode 1)
  (menu-bar-mode 1)
  (text-scale-set 0)
  (artist-select-op-spray-can))
#+END_SRC


*** Or draw lines						      :slide:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(progn
  (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "*artist*"))
  (artist-select-op-line))
#+END_SRC

** No seriously, we can do real work!				      :slide:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sec:data-tab-code
   :END:

Use this table as a data source.
#+tblname: tab-data
| x |  y |
|---+----|
| 1 |  1 |
| 2 |  4 |
| 3 |  9 |
| 4 | 16 |

#+BEGIN_SRC python :var data=tab-data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
d = np.array(data)
plt.plot(d[:, 0], d[:, 1])
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

You can make links to a table like this: ref:tab-data.
** Interactive links						      :slide:
<<beginning>>

You can have links that take you to places: [[beginning]], [[end]], to a [[#sec:data-tab-code][section]],

Or links that are functional: cite:mehta-2014-ident-poten.

Or that run code [[elisp:(message "Hello %s" user-full-name)]]

Or links to info: [[info:org#External%20links][info:org#External links]]

Or to open a [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu][website]].

<<end>>

Yes, org-mode is amazing.

** Conclusions							      :slide:
That is the end!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(org-show-animate '("That's the end of the org-show." "Thank you for your attention!" "http://github.com/jkitchin/jmax"))
#+END_SRC

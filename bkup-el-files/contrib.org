* which-key

There are /many/ key-bindings in scimax that can be hard to remember, or even know about. Shreyas Ragavan (shrysr) suggested in https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/issues/344 that ~which-key~ could help with this, with this suggested implementation.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defcustom scimax-which-key 'nil
  "Scimax option to enable or disable which-key. Defaults to `nil'.
Set to 1 to install and enable which-key."
  :group 'scimax)


(when scimax-which-key
  (use-package which-key
  :ensure nil
  :defer nil
  :config
  (which-key-mode)))
#+END_SRC

Then, when you type a key sequence that is only partially complete you get a minibuffer that pops up showing you all the possible completions. For example, if I type C-c in this buffer and wait a bit, this pops up:

;;; scimax-literate-programming.el --- Literate programming tools for org-mode

;;; Commentary:
;; This library adds code navigation via M-. and M-, in literate program
;; org-files. It works by creating and visiting a TAGS file for the src-blocks
;; in the file.
;;
;; This works by creating a temporary version of the org-file with everything
;; but the relevant code stripped out, and then running etags on this temporary
;; version of the file. Only blocks that should be tangled are included in this
;; file.
;;
;; You have to generate a TAGS file first with `scimax-lp-generate-tags' which will
;; work on all the org-files in the current directory, including recursive
;; descent into all subdirectories. The languages that are supported are defined
;; in `scimax-lp-etags-language-map'. The TAGS are not automatically updated, if you
;; add new definitions, you should rerun `scimax-lp-generate-tags'. After this, when
;; you are on a symbol defined in the current org-file M-. should jump to the
;; definition, and M-, should jump back.
;;
;; `scimax-lp-signature-doc' can be used to try getting a signature/docstring for the
;; symbol at point. In emacs-lisp blocks this works on functions and variables.
;; In other languages it will just return the line where the symbol is defined.

;;; scimax-spellcheck.el --- Spell-check setup for scimax

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; I currently use hunspell, because it seems more up to date than aspell. It is
;; a little irritating to install though. For the Windows scimax, it should be
;; bundled in the installed files. On a mac, you can brew install hunspell, but
;; you have to download your own dictionaries and put them in
;; ~/Library/Spelling. These are not currently part of scimax.
;;

;; Adapted from https://manuel-uberti.github.io/emacs/2016/06/06/spellchecksetup/

;; [2019-08-10 Sat] I took out some mac/windows specific things. The plan is to
;; get this to work generally as much as possible, and not to hack a special
;; solution for windows.
